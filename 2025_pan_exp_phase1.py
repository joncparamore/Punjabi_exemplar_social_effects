#PHASE 1: Baseline Code. Should display one word at a time and a timer, instructing participants to read word aloud as fastly and clearly as possible. 

#Import Library for interface - maybe use a different library than tkinter?

import tkinter as tk
import time



#Set up GUI

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Baseline Window")
root.geometry("300x200")
root.mainloop()

#Import wordlist

#Create Timer


#Set up point system for fast responses

points = 0



#Instruction screen?


#Loop that displays each word, runs the timer for each word, awards points for each word, writes messages




#Random messages indicating the speech was not fast/clear enough
